<b> FeedEngine - What are you building? Does it feel like it could be a legit product that people want to use? </b>

The focus of our FeedEngine project is on building a feed app that builds photo feeds.  We are looking to integrate with Flickr, Instagram and 500 Pixels and I think the site could be a fun thing for someone to use.  A lot of application functionality these days focuses on creating a stream of content, so we'd probably have some serious competition from the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr if we ever got serious with the idea.  I suppose for a site like 500px that attracts an audience of photographers looking for inspiration, it would be cool to have an aggregator of your favorite photo streams.  

<b> You’ve been through the project wringer a few times now. What strategies are you using to help your team work effectively? How are they going so far? Is there anything different about how you approach a three-week team versus a two-week team? </b>

For a team to work effectively, I think it's helpful for each member of the team to know as much about the code as possible.  It's great that for this project we are starting from scratch and as a team we are trying to spend as many of the early hours together as possible.  So far almost all of the code we have committed has been written in at least pairs if not with the whole group.  I think it's going well so far, but then again pressure to complete tasks really hasn't mounted up yet.  I'm happy with our progress.

Personally I'm doing my best to get involved in as many aspects of the project as possible.  There are a lot of new concepts being thrown our way this time around, so I want to make sure I can have concrete examples of what we are learning in our code.  It's definitely the best way to learn.  I think it's important to not burn out too quickly in such a long project and I think it's important to consider all the different viewpoints my teammates bring to the table. 

<b> If you’re looking for a job after gSchool, what are some of the attributes that are most important to you about a company / position / team? How will you know when you’ve found the right fit? </b>

I am looking for a job after gSchool and I think the most important aspect of a company is the team I'll be working in.  I definitely don't want or think I'm ready to be the one man dev team at any small startup, but I want to work for a smaller team that is doing cool things with software.  I've been putting more thought into this recently and I'm glad that a lot of the interviews in this field are hands on.  I like the idea of getting a feel for the team before making a decision.  I definitely want to work for a company that isn't only doing Rails development but strong mobile work as well.
