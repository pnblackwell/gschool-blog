<b> DoSE - Yesterday’s projects seemed much stronger than the last round. What changes did you make to your process or expectations? What would you do if, just hypothetically, you were going to continue working on the project another two weeks. </b>

First of all, I'm very glad that the second part of the question is only hypothetical.  I learned a lot this project, but I think I'm ready to move on to another kind of challenge.  I actually wouldn't say that yesterday's performance was as much process as it just illustrated huge differences in expectations an subject matter.  Son of Store Engine required us to inherit from an existing store engine project and make it successfully multi-tenant.  That in itself is a complex problem to comprehend and then solve when you're using unfamilair.  Being able to test properly and use best practices with these new challenges is something that doesn't come easily.  I know my group took about a third to half of the last project just trying to accomplish that part and maintain all of the functionality from before.  On top of that we had to learn and incorporate performance and then polish it out with some design.  To fully complete the task, it required a lot more corners to be cut, so as a result we had much sloppier projects last time.  

This time around we were given features on top of a project that we were already familiar with.  Even though we were inheriting another project, the fundamentals behind it didn't change too much and therefore we knew what we were working with much better.  There weren't many problems that we were stuck on for days and we knew that fewer complete features were better than many slightly incomplete ones.  We expected that everything we shipped had to be well tested and thoroughly checked before it saw our clients.  We also had many more checkins with our client this time around so it lead to a better understanding of expectations.  If we were going to work on the project more, we would probably work more on better performance and we would probably try to incorporate more jquery into our application.

<b> APIs - Next week we’ll start both consuming and producing APIs. What sounds interesting, difficult, or exciting about building applications that talk to other applications? </b>

The only thing that sounds difficult about building APIs is that I've never done it before.  I'm pretty excited to be moving past ecommerce and I think building applications that talk to other ones is exciting.  Most of the tools that I want to build would have to talk to other applications so this is a subject that I'm excited about.

<b> Last week you wrote about your strengths and weaknesses with Rails specifically. Were you able to address any of those weaknesses this week? </b>

Last week I probably felt weaker with regards to my abilities to work on the front end and test effectively. I worked on those two aspects the most this week and I'm more confident about my abilities after this project.
