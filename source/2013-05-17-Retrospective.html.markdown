<b> For FeedEngine, what have been the tough parts so far? </b>

FeedEngine has been an interesting learning experience with getting familiar with third party APIs.  We had a little difficulty integrating with the Flickr API and the headache caused us to switch over to having users authenticate using Twitter.  The problem basically came down to API documentation.  There was little help with Flickr and Twitter was much better documented.  

<b> What's the plan for the next six days? </b>

The next six days should be pretty busy with getting as much as we can out the door.  Obviously, we've all learned from previous experience, and we know that code that is below a certain quality isn't worth shipping at all.  We've also learned that come Tuesday, anything that hasn't been started already, shouldn't be attempted last minute.  There's nothing like having code break the night before or day it's due.  We've done integration with logging in users and with bringing content onto our site, so the core functionality and hurdles of the mvp are out of the way.  We still have a lot to do, but at least we've figured out some sort of working integration that should give us a good base for going into the weekend.

<b> What is it going to be like when you finish? </b>

If this question is asking what the project is going to be like when we finish, I can't really say at this moment.  I think the project will have clean design and a fun functionality.  Personally, I'll probably be relieved when it's over, just like every project.  The tension difference between a few days before a project and a few days after is always a big one.  I'm excited and nervous for the individual project coming up, so I'll probably be preparing ideas for that.

I was sick yesterday for Boulder Startup Week, but I've definitely noticed that when we have outside sources that give us context for what we're doing in class- like how they talk about the real world problems they're solving with code, it makes me excited.  Today we had an interview with Clay Johnson and hearing him talk about how he's solved problems on such a large scale was inspiring because it really struck a chord with me about how developers can solve problems in such a scalable way to effect the world in a large way.
