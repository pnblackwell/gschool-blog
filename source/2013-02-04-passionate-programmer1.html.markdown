1) Was there a tip that rung true to your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar?

Tip number 10: "Love it or leave it" and tip number 14: "Be a Mentor" stood out to me as a result of my experience working at an email marketing startup last year.  I remember being confronted in my own mind that I truly did not want to be doing that kind of work and I was actually surrounded by a few who did.  They were always eager to stay after and discuss new strategy.  They were also always eager to attend networking events and to read up on the industry in their spare time.  I quickly found myself playing a game of catch-up because I was always following their interest to where it would lead them.  I worked hard, but it didn't compare to their desire to conquer the marketing world right out of college.  I realized that in order to be at the top of my game, I had to find passion first.  

At this company we also were developing procedures for people who would be doing our jobs in the future.  Having to write down our processes and having to describe the useful knowledge I gained along the way actually wound up helping me in my own job.  It was an exercise we did halfway through the internship and I noticed that I was able to focus on the important parts of my job better after I had taken a step back and analyzed them.  

2) Was there a tip that you disagreed with?  How/why?

I disagreed with tip 28, the Eight Hour Burn. I certainly agree that time is most valualbe when it is made finite and even better when it's made scarce, but I think that the whole idea of going at a pace that lasts for 8 hours doesn't seem to be that useful.  A lot of the tips in the book seem to be pragmatic and this tip doesn't seem to be that way.  Sure it's not wise to work yourself into the ground- especially not whnen your job relies on problem solving and an angile brain.  Instead what should be done is that you look at goals.  You focus on what needs to get done and you budget your time around that.  That actually seems to be a step toward understanding something that he says is unquantifiable: the value of a developer's time.

3) Some of the tips seem obvious, but what was one that surprised you?

One that surprised me was number 18, Automate yourself into a job."  I found that to be strange because usually you think of automation as a job killer, but he argues that you look for things that are reptitive in real life that we could look for software to solve.
