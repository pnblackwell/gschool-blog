This book doesn't seem that outdated at all when it comes to the general ideas behind it.  The messages in this book may have seeped into common knowledge territory by now, especially since they were already pretty close to begin with, but they still ring as true as ever.  The section on satisficing examines a profound idea on how we as people operate.  It's funny because a lot of the ideas brought forth seem to be proved correct if you examine this course as an allegorical example.  We are thrown more information than we can possibly cram into the time that we're given almost constantly.  I'm writing this blog post as I'm waiting for my partner to finish up his portion of our project so that I can help him complete the portion.  It's almost midnight and I'm trying to get through this reading and I'm trying to be thoughtful about our assigned reading. Limited attention is the name of the game in this course and it often dictates how in depth we are able to go into any given topic.
