<b> How's it feel to be back in a group? Did you learn any lessons working on your own that you’re now bringing through the group? </b>

I'm really liking my group this time around.  Geoff, Logan, and Kyle are great to work with and I think our personalities work well together.  I did miss being able to focus on one thing and have other group members focus on other things. When I was working on my indiviual project I was often hurried and distracted by the onus of also making sure that the entire project was on track.  From a learning perspective I'm not sure which is better because there is a serious tradeoff: either do all of the work yourself and understand every bit of code and maybe not deliver as awesome of a finished product, or work in a team and focus on a fewer parts that you learn and execute better.  

<b> Do you feel like you’re understanding the concept of services? What makes sense and what’s still confusing? </b>

I think I'm understanding the concept of services. We've actually been able to implement a decent amount of our services structure already, so seeing it in practice makes it make a whole lot of sense.  What confuses me about services is figuring out when they are useful.  I get the idea of extracting components of a program, but I still don't understand when I would really use one unless I was required to do so.  The way that we're implementing it now isn't really simplifying the process much.

<b> Have you dug into using websockets with Faye? How has it gone so far? </b>

We worked with Faye for the first couple of days, but we've decided that we want to work with Pusher. We're working on implementing our chat/messaging functionality first and then we're going to use Pusher on top of that.


<b> How’s the job hunt going? Have you applied for jobs? Interviewed? Any lessons learned? </b>

The job hunt hasn't really started too much for me yet.  I've scoped out a few I want to email this weekend and I had an interview yesterday.  I'm definitely learning a lot from the people that are visiting us and giving us advice.  To be honest though, I haven't been worrying too much about jobs yet because I'm trying to get as much out of this course as possible and looking for a job is a huge endeavor.
