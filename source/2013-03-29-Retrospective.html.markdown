I'm approaching Rails differently than I approached picking up Ruby.  I like that for Rails we started off immediately working with projects.  Blogger was a very guided exercise, but I enjoyed the fact that we were diving right into the context of Rails' usefulness.  The most confusing component of Rails is making sure I'm using the right conventions in addition to being distracted byall of the functionality it offers.  Right now it feels like there is so much about Rails that I don't know and that urge to learn as much as I can sometimes gets in the way of my immediate focus on the projects we have.  That said, I think this week has been incredibly productive for me. I'm already working on my second Rails project and I'm quickly understanding how Rails makes life easier.  The code that we have to write for our relationship models is so small it's almost hard to believe that it works.  

The increased focus on pairing this week has been ok. We as a group have already been pairing a great deal, so the increased emphasis hasn't really encouraged or dissuaded me from doing it more. The natural progression of our group for Store Engine is to code together or in pairs of pairs at the beginning of each new section where we talk through it and then we eventually will break off.  I'm actually finding that while I'm learning, solo work is the most productive because I'm able to learn at my own pace.  The best situation is when I'm working on Sales Engine and I have an outside resource that's solving a similar problem. I learn the best that way I think.   

I'm finding that working in a group of four is actually slower than a pair.  We are putting a strong emphasis on learning while trying to get through the project and as a result we are stopping quite frequently. I think this is a good approach and when we break off we tend to get things done, but I'm not sure if I would say for certain that more people makes a project go faster.  Instead I think the biggest benefit of working in such a large group is having the different perspectives and experiences on the same team. 

The demo is so far away and I have no idea what to expect from the future.
