What was the most surprising thing about your work on the project?

This may sound strange, but the thing that surprised me most about my work on this project was that I was right.  I was right about what tripped me up on the last project: minute language details.  I know that syntax and understanding the programming language is just as important as understanding the concepts, but working with a partner who is rather familiar with Ruby made it much easier because a lot of my ideas of how to write the code got filtered through his experience and it produced a lot more flow when it came to solving problems.  Before I was struggling with syntax errors constantly, and while it was important to work through them and see where I went wrong, I wasn't able to fully think through the code or through solving larger problems than minor errors.  I was also able to constantly compare what I would do versus what he would do and it made for a good learning experience.

How many hours did you put in? How many of them were valuable?  Could the valuable ones exist without the invaluable?  How will you replicate or change your schedule for the next project?

I'm not exactly sure how many hours went in to the project, but we spent a good portion of every working day working on the project. The only real late nights working on it were during the weekend.  This was very different than the last project I worked on as well.  I spent as much time on it as I could and I didn't sleep much and the result wasn't that great.  For this project, we spent a lot of the earlier hours mapping out what to do and we worked in small chunks that we made sure were moving toward our larger goal.  Unfortunately, we did abandon Pivotal Tracking pretty early, and that may be something I can work on for next time, but I would say that the overall takeaway from this project is to have as clear a goal at the beginning as possible.  Breaking the project down into what you know you want makes all the difference.  I've also realized in comparing these two projects that time spent asking questions to get yourself unstuck is always time well spent.  We did that early and often in this process and it allowed us to get that clear picture much quicker than last time.

If you were going to start the project again on Tuesday, what would you do differently?

The only thing that comes to mind is I wish we had more of what was required in our testing earlier.  I wish we had been told we were going to make our API into a gem and test it as such.  We had some last minute headaches just because we weren't expecting to deal with that sort of integration, but on the whole, I plan on approaching the next project similarly.

Focusing on the pair work process, what did your pair do well? What did you struggle with? 

I thought our pair worked well.  We made steady progress throughout the week and we were able to finish well.  As the less experienced developer, I struggled a little with trying to contribute as much as possible.  I thought we did a good job of splitting up the work though.  We would usually reason out a section of the project together and we would break out and work on what we thought should be done.   The merging with Git was sometimes irritating, but we ultimately got it done.

What's something that worked but you have no idea how/why?

Up until yesterday I had no idea how our revenue method worked because one night my partner refactored it using a lambda which was completely foreign to me.  I think I get it now, but I definitely wouldn't have done it that way.

You’ve finished your first real project. NOW are you a developer? Why/why not?

I feel like a world class beginner when it comes to solving problems in the developer world.  I would consider myself a developer not only because I wake up thinking about code, but also because I spend the majority of my time solving problems and creating software.  It may be basic at this point, but that doesn't change the fact that we're making software.

We’re about to start shifting to a web context. What is interesting about that? What’s nervewracking?

No.  That's where all the people are. I'm interested in creating web products, so while it's pretty foreign to me to work on developing things for the web, I'm very interested in getting going.
