<b> Who's your mentor, where do they work, what do they do and what have you done with them so far? How are they affecting your workflow? What value do you think theyâ€™ll bring to your learning experience? </b>

My mentor is Bryan Powell and he is the founder and lead developer of Metabahn which is a dev shop out of Huntsville, Alabama.  They work on rails and mobile apps primarily.  2013 is actually a pivot year for them because Bryan says they are at a place where they can start working on their own projects and hopefully start developing new products.  We met this Monday via Skype and he went on vacation this Wednesday, so I haven't really been able to get too far past introduction.  We have a scheduled call for next week where we will discuss rails, related technologies, and bootstrapping your own business.  I'm excited to have someone I can discuss future plans with and it's nice to have someone with real world experience who is willing to help guide me on my way.  He's also seems like a very nice guy.

<b> What's different about the larger project group? What's it like working on a legacy project? What were the hardest parts about getting started? Do you feel like you understand the existing project yet? </b>

I'm actually working in a smaller group than last time because one member of my group is in San Francisco for half of the project.  The most interesting part about this particular project is that we're using his code for our Son of Store Engine project.  Not having him here makes it a bit difficult to move at the pace we'd like. I think it's giving us good experience of having to understand code that isn't necessarily intuitive.  The hardest part about getting started is understanding how the ideas you have will break other aspects of this unfamiliar code.  I feel like I understand the existing project well enough to work on it, but if I were to ask this question a week from now, I'd say that at this point I had no idea what I was doing back when I first started.  I'm finding that's how every project works at gSchool- I think I know what's going on until I actually build the project and then I walk away with a more complete sense of what the project entailed.

<b> What roles are you taking on your current project? Are those the same or different than you've taken in past teams? </b>

So far in this project I've been working mostly by myself while my other two team members pair. It's put more responsibility on me as far as learning and executing goes, so I feel like I'm contributing more.  I'm also focusing a lot more on the backend than I was focusing on last project. I'm dealing with authorization and multi-tenancy which is a lot different than what I tackled last time.
