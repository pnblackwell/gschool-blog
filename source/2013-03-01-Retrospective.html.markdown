<b>We're officially one month in.  How are you feeling?</b>

It's crazy that we've already been here a month.  I'm surprised at how much differently I view programming now.  This may be the sleep deprivation talking, but it's hard to remember what it was like before we started here.  I am definitely satisifed with my progress thusfar.  Everyday this week something new has clicked for me and it's starting to happen more frequently.  I think a lot of programming prowess comes from familiarity and I feel like I'm getting closer to being functionally familiar with Ruby.

<b>How has your relationship to your peers matched or contrasted with your expectations? Do you think that will change at all during the remaining five months?</b>

As someone with minimal programming experience before gSchool, and as someone who realized how hard it was to teach yourself programming without a support group around you, I am encouraged by the group around me.  My peers are making the learning process easier and they are a great group to have around.  It definitely helps to learn with a group around you going through the same curriculum because you are allowed to engage with their questions and ideas and it helps in the learning process.  

<b> Monday we'll conduct our first individual skills evaluation.  How do you think it'll go? What will be your strengths and weaknesses?</b>

I think if the evaluation is based on concepts that we have gone over in class or concepts that we were working on in projects, I think it will go well.I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on what we've learned so far.  I feel that my strenghts will be in the concepts that we have learned thus far, and I feel like my weaknesses are in getting projects or problems started.  So if we are to look at code and decipher what it does, I think I would do ok, but if we are told to solve a multi-part problem I would be less confident in my ability to set the problem up.

<b>Make a resolution for the next month-what are you going to focus on doing better</b>

I spent most of last night staying up trying to learn a concept that I probably could have asked Franklin or Jeff and their answer would have taken a fraction of the time.  I want to get better at asking questions earlier, but in general I want to get better at mapping problems from start to finish so I can anticipate road blocks.  I also want to write in this blog more often.

<b>Is working on the web more exciting than our command-line aplications?</b>

It definitely is.  My favorite lecture in gSchool was the one that Jeff gave on Monday when he just described how internet works and how web applications work.  The strucutre of web applications is slightly more confusing, but it's only because it's less familiar.  The model view controller method is pretty different than what I'm used to, but like everything else in this class, it'll be familiar soon enough.  Working on the web also feels like a big step toward working on what we're ultimately heading toward, so I like that we're getting the experience now.
