The concept that was the most advanced to think about was the form section.  It was the most involved and you can send me an email about it <a href="mailto:pnblackwell@gmail.com"> here</a>

I think understanding how forms work is an essential piece of fully undertanding how applications work.  I don't know of a single application that doesn't use some sort of form.  

A form is a place within an application where you can take in input from a user based on specified parameters.  In a form you can do things like adding text input, password input, checking boxes, etc.  The following code is the code that I used to create the form.

``` <form action="http://www.example.com/login.php"> <p>Username:
    <input type="text" name="username" size="15"
      maxlength="30" />
</p> </form> 
```

Here's my example form...

<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php"> <p>Username:
    <input type="text" name="username" size="15"
      maxlength="30" />
</p> </form>
