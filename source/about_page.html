We began our entrepreneurial journey about three years ago, shortly after our
parents started beekeeping. They were extremely excited with the prospect of
us selling the honey we harvested from our two backyard hives. We learned
that two hives were only enough to supply our hungry family and a handful of
neighbors with honey, but there was a surprising and intriguing by-product:
beeswax. Was there something we could do with the beeswax so it wasn’t
wasted? With the popularity of beeswax lip balm, we quickly started researching
recipes. We wanted natural ingredients and a great consistency. We made a
few batches and people loved it. Our parents thought a lip balm business would
be a wonderful learning experience. We found some more local beeswax on
craigslist, ordered a bunch of empty tubes online, and were off and running.

It was time to begin designing and marketing our business. Our parents
arranged for us to sell our Sweet Bee Lip Balm at the Young Americans
Marketplace. We were given a booth and had a very good first sale. Our
business just took off from there. The first year we only had Peppermint. The
next year we added Vanilla, Strawberry, Root Beer, and Tropical Fruit. Over the
years we’ve made little changes here and there to our business, but our biggest
change occurred this past Christmas when we released our newest product:
lotion bars. We have four different scents: Bamboo, Lavender, Dream, and
Unscented. So far, our lotion bars have been selling extremely well—people love
the unique concept, and it works great!

Being in business as Sweet Bee Sisters is awesome. We are learning a ton
about business, working together as sisters, and providing great products to
appreciative customers. We can’t wait to see where this all leads.
