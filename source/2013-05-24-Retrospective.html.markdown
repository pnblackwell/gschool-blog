<h2> Feed Engine </h2>

<b> Were you happy with your final product? </b>

I was happy that our <a href="photoline-feed.us"> project </a> was functionally sound and that we focused on doing less things well over more things poorly.  I wish our design up front was better and that we had more time to work on it, but I was definitely satisfied with most of our code's quality.  

<b> No application is perfect, but did your project adequately represent your team's three weeks of work? </b>

I'm not sure, because a lot of our difficulties happened on the backend, so our three weeks of work showed a lot in how well refactored our code was and how much easier it was to implement new integrations on top of what we already had written.

<b> What parts were harder than expected? Easier </b>

We had originally planned on having people authenticate using Flickr, but that proved to be more complicated than we thought.  We spent a few days trying to integrate with Flickr but we eventually settled with Twitter.  Because authentication is such an early step in the app usage process, we were hung up on it and didn't do much else.  We successfully integrated with it for pulling in content, so dealing with that application became a win.

<b> How did it deepen or change your opinions on APIs </b>

To be honest, this project and these few weeks in school have made me less afraid of APIs.  I definitely attribute this to familiarity.  Speaking in JSON is intimidating at first, but once you're familiar with it, I feel much more able to go deep into APIs and get what I want.  I didn't really have an opinion of APIs before.
