<b> Now that you’ve completed the time allotted to your personal project, how does it match up with your expectations? If you thought it’d be super hard, was it? If you thought you’d move incredibly quickly, did you? </b>

My quest on my personal project still continues actually.  My biggest difficulty was in getting authorization for my app's users with Harvest's site and the problem still hasn't been resolved.  I paired with Katrina, Frank, and Ryan for what must have been a total of 3ish hours and still no luck.  I'm still communicating with the Harvest support team because I really want to get this thing built.  I wasn't expecting that piece of the project to take so long and I'm still wondering if I should have re-pivoted earlier.  The funny thing is that the part that I anticipated taking the least amount of time took 90% of my time.  The documentation seemed to indicate that the process was simple, but man was I surprised.

<b> If you are going to continue development, how are you planning to keep yourself dedicated to the goal? </b>

I picked this project in the first place because I really wanted to use this product.  The motivation is not only intrinsic in that way, but now that I've had so much difficulty I don't really want to stop until I've figured everything out.  I also think this project will be good practice for a lot of concepts that are important: TDD, TDD w/ Javascript, another integration, CSS, AJAX.  I was very impressed by the d3 integrations that some of my classmates were able to pull off and I would like to add that to an analytical backend at some point so users can track what they've been able to do.  I'm excited to get this thing built and the additional pieces that I have yet to do might make this a great mastery project.
