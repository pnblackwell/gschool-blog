This iteration of the project we decided to go the different route of focusing on quality before hitting the deliver button.  Before we had an emphasis on getting the product out (usually untested) to our client.  While this seemed to help us get through the problem faster, we definitely didn't spend the time we should have on our project.  The challenges working with an existing code base are coming down to the test coverage that we inherited and some of the logical decisions that the group before us made.  There is a lot of logic in our controllers and it's making it somewhat difficult to test our application.  Working closely with clients allows you to focus on the pieces of application that really matter.  You get to have feedback on what are the more essential features to work on first and the iterations on a working master branch allow you to not have to worry too much down the road about a product that is working when you want to deploy.  I definitely prefer the agile approach.
