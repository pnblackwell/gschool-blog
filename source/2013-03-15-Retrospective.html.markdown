This week was perfect for getting back to the basics.  We spent a great deal of time this week working on mastering testing as a mechanism for writing and understanding our code better.  We had spent a lot of time before working on projects and I felt like I was more concerned with churning out a finished product than a product that was complete with testing.  I appreciated our group taking the time to go through and understand what we were doing.  When I was writing programs before I looked at testing more as a way to tell me if my code was doing the thing that I wanted it to and not as much a tool for building the cleanest program I could.  We spent a lot of this week writing code that was only to do the least amount of work to make the test pass.  I have the habit of getting ahead of that methodology and it's a problem that I'm glad I'm working toward breaking because it minimizes headache later on.  When you try to tackle too much at once you get stranger errors that often aren't that helpful because you and the computer are rarely on the same page.

This week was also a good time to get other people's perspectives on the same problems.  These past few weeks we have been working in pairs and not getting to see as many other projects as I would have liked.  The process of working through problems with other people is also beneficial to getting good at programming.  When you go slowly on a problem and work with other people you are also able to really figure out what you know and what you don't know.

No rest for the wicked.
