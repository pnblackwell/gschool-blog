<b> Another project in the books. How did you feel about your contribution to your team's project?</b>

It was a crazy two weeks getting this project done.  I feel good about my contribution to my team's project.  Pairing up in problem solving is always a strange endeavor because solving problems requires focus and it is hard to focus when you're communicating with someone else.  It's almost distracting to be in a pair, but then there's the fact that talking through your solutions is often the best way to reason.  I've done this for the past two projects now: confer with the partner in planning the larger steps and then break apart so that we can each focus on solving the problems.  I actually spent a good deal of my personal time learning about the different technologies that we were using and it allowed me to contribute what I did.  It was definitely a challenging project.  Speaking of segues...

<b>What did you think of Sinatra? Sequel? Would you enjoy using these tools on a larger project? Did you think their APIs were logical and reasonable, or are there changes you'd like to see?</b>

Sinatra was definitely different for me.  It took a little while for me to even understand what it did, let alone how to implement it.  I'm struggling still with being able to test effectively. I could see myself getting used to it for a larger project.  Sequel seems to be an important tool all around.  I also can see how it would be useful- especially when we're able to use all of the tools in the future.  I think Sequel will be a big part of our future, so I would like to use these to a larger extent in a larger project.  Both APIs were reasonable, sure.

<b>Now that you really understand the problem, what would you do differently if you could go back to the beginning?  Were the parts you thought would be hard actually hard? What about the parts you thought would be easy?</b>

I thought the work with databases was going to be a lot harder than it was.  What was actually hardest was creating objects from payload input and making that interact with the database.  Actually, I take that back, I think the testing portion of this project was the most challenging.  Getting all of our tests to be falsifiable and effective was difficult. If we could go back to the beginning, I would do more TDD and break the problem down more from the beginning.  There's no way we would have known how to do it from the beginning though, without first building the project, so it's hard to say what I would have done differently.

<b>What stuck with you from the [Obama for America] event yesterday?</b>

I thought the event was very cool.  I was surprised that they built most of the platform with PHP and Ruby.  I wasn't expecting Ruby to get any love, but as it turns out it was significant .  I was also shocked about the difference in technical staff size from 2008 to 2012.  Harper said that in 2008, we used the online tools and in 2012 our parents did- that stuck.  As a result a staff of 15 people became 150 people and it's crazy how much change really has happened so recently in the need for good software in order to communicate with large audiences.

<b>Would you go all in, for 12 hour days seven days a week for politics?</b>

If I really believed in the candidate or movement I would. 

<b>Are you feeling relatively comfortable with databases, or is it, to paraphrase the amazing Bill O’Reilly, "data goes in, data goes out, you can’t explain that!"</b>

I feel like a mixture of both.  There are still some questions, but I've reached a point where I don't really question too much of how this is happening and I focus on testing databases out to see if they are giving me consistent output.  I'm definitely as bad as Papa Bill though.
