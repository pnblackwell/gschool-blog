<h1> Individual Project </h1>

<b> Now that you’ve been working on your own for a week, how does it match up with your expectations? If you thought it’d be super hard, was it? If you thought you’d move incredibly quickly, did you? </b>

Working alone has been a good experience.  I like touching 100% of the code that I put my name on, but it definitely isn't moving quicker.  A lot of this project involves learning new technology or accessing somewhat unfamiliar APIs.  I'm still working on integrating my app with Harvest, so it would be nice to have different perspectives on problem solving, but I do feel like I'm learning a lot more now.

<b> Given that you’ve defined an MVP and are almost halfway through, do you feel like you’ve gotten half of the work done? If not, do you expect progress to speed up? Why? </b>

I feel like I'm around halfway done on creating an mvp, but I would like to get a lot more done than just the minimum product, which brings me to the next question....

<b> Working on your own, do you feel like you’re spending more time stuck on problems or are you more likely to ask for help? </b>

I think to accomplish making the next half as productive as I possibly can, I need to ask more people for help and get more involved with others' perspectives as opposed to trying to learn things on my own.  


<h2> The Future </h2>

<b> It’s seven weeks until we’re finished. What do you intend to focus on during that time? Why is that the most important thing? </b>

I intend on making the things we've already covered in class more second nature to me than they are.  I want to start solidifying the knowledge that we've worked on in class so that I can better recall how to approach solving problems in the future.  I think the curriculum is designed to give us a knowledge base that will make us competent developers and there's plenty to work on.  I want to take a pomodoro each day and review the different aspects of tutorials and projects that we've worked on so that I can confidently present my skillset in the future.

<b> Coming into the program you had an idea of what success looked like. Is it within reach? Or has your goal changed along the way? </b>

I think success in programming is having the tools to figure out what it is you're trying to do and to have some sort of context about the different ways you could go about it and their pros and cons.  Having a project that you can struggle through where you don't necessarily have a date of delivery is not mastery in my opinion.  I think before I thought being a programmer was knowing more than being fluent enough to figure it out.  I see programming now as more of the latter.  I think it is within reach.  My initial goals were to be able to build products that I would want to use or sell and I think that goal is within reach.
