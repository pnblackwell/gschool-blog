<b> What did you learn about Rails during Store Engine? How does that shape your plan for the next project? </b>

I learned almost everything I know about rails during this project, so a lot.  Besides the fundamentals that I picked up during the project, I feel that the biggest lessons I'm taking away are going to be surrounding the natural progression of a rails project.  I think our group did a good job with prioritizing places to start and build out first and I don't think I would have been as successful without having more experienced partners. For example, before doing real web development I was unaware of how much progress can be made in functionality with having a very dull front-end. We focused a lot on modeling in the beginning and built out very little on the front end outside of some simple displays and some forms.  The novice in me was worried about our progress when our front-end looked nothing like we wanted it to ultimately look like.  I think experience gives you a general understanding of how long certain pieces take and what goes into them and I'm very happy to have that under my belt.

<b> What did you learn about working in a larger team during Store Engine?  What things will you do the same or different during the next project? </b>

The funny thing about working in a larger team is that it doesn't necessarily make the project go faster.  I'm sure it can, but it only seems more efficient if you know what you're doing and you know the people involved.  It's hard to say what I'll do for the next project because it will depend on who is in my group and what kind of dynamic we have with our preferences and personalities.  I think pairing or working as a group at the beginning of sections is important because it allows everyone to be on the same page. I think it helps projects evolve more naturally and I think it opens up communication better when groups have tried to solve problems together.

<b> Do you feel like your team was 50-100% more productive than a two-person team?  How does that inform your thinking about the way teams are constructed? </b>

I feel like our team moved at a slightly faster pace than a two-person team, but I think our objective wasn't to get the project done as quickly as possible.  This project, at least early on, we focused on learning as much as possible. At first we made it a point to only move forward when all of the team understood what we were doing.  Given the time constraint, we realized that was an untenable goal, but we still strove to focus on understanding.  To solve complex problems I think teams should be constructed with diversity of skill in mind.  I think my team illustrated how that can work effectively.  We had someone who knew the back end very well and we had someone who knew front-end design quite well and I think it resulted in a good product.
